# Fashion-MNIST 

## Introduction
**Image classification** using **KNN** and **DOPISAÄ†**. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images - consisting
of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated 
with a label from 10 classes. More about [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
Our goal is to build a **K-NN model** and a **dopisz** to classify an image with cloth to which class it belongs.
